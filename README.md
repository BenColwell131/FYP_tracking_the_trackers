# FYP_tracking_the_trackers
Final Year Project

Two main goals of this project:

- Develop a user tool for capturing and analysing WebSocket traffic; as well as blocking any WebSocket connections used for tracking or ad-serving.

- Investigate how widely used WebSockets are, both in general and as tracking tools.
